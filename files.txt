# TACS Project File Analysis

## Files to DELETE (not used or redundant)
- debug_training.cpp                    # Not referenced in CMakeLists.txt, likely a debug file
- test_json_debug.cpp                   # Already deleted, was likely a debug file
- create_initial_weights.cpp            # Redundant - we have create_pretrained_weights.cpp

## Files to BRING BACK (improve the app)
### High Priority - Core Functionality
- include/federated/crypto_utils.h      # Needed for secure federated learning
- include/layers/conv2d_fp16.h          # FP16 optimization for faster inference
- scripts/generate_synthetic_dataset.py  # Useful for generating training data
- scripts/train_based_on_dataset.py     # Python training scripts for comparison
- inference_99_accuracy.cpp             # Contains optimized inference parameters for 99% accuracy

### Medium Priority - Testing and Validation
- train_tacsnet_99.cpp                  # Specialized training for 99% accuracy target
- test_tacsnet_training.cpp             # Unit tests for training functionality
- test_adaptive_optimizer.cpp           # Tests for adaptive optimizer
- test_model_forward.cpp                # Tests for model forward pass

### Low Priority - Alternative Implementations
- train_model.cpp                       # Generic training script (train_tacsnet.cpp is sufficient)
- train_adaptive.cpp                    # Redundant with adaptive optimizer in train_tacsnet.cpp
- train_tacsnet_adaptive.cpp            # Redundant - adaptive features already integrated
- test_training_adaptation.cpp          # Can be merged with test_adaptive_optimizer.cpp
- test_tacsnet_simple.cpp               # Basic tests covered by phase validations

## Files to ADD TO GIT (currently untracked but used)
- src/training/adaptive_optimizer.cpp    # Referenced in CMakeLists.txt line 97
- include/training/adaptive_optimizer.h  # Referenced in CMakeLists.txt line 141
- src/training/gradient_converter.cpp    # Referenced in CMakeLists.txt line 100
- include/training/gradient_converter.h  # Should be added for completeness
- create_pretrained_weights.cpp          # Referenced in CMakeLists.txt line 233

## Files that can STAY DELETED
- include/plugin/plugin_system_simple.h  # Replaced by full plugin_system
- src/plugin/plugin_system_simple.cpp    # Replaced by full plugin_system
- include/stb_image_write.h             # External dependency, not needed
- VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md                 # Documentation, not critical
- train_99_accuracy.sh                  # Bash script, functionality in C++ now

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Add untracked files to git that are referenced in CMakeLists.txt
   - Delete debug_training.cpp and create_initial_weights.cpp
   
2. **For 99% Accuracy Goal:**
   - Bring back inference_99_accuracy.cpp for optimized inference parameters
   - Consider bringing back train_tacsnet_99.cpp if current training doesn't reach target
   
3. **For Production Readiness:**
   - Bring back conv2d_fp16.h for FP16 optimization
   - Bring back crypto_utils.h for secure federated learning
   
4. **For Testing:**
   - Bring back test_tacsnet_training.cpp and test_adaptive_optimizer.cpp
   - These will help ensure training stability and correctness

5. **Simplification:**
   - Keep only train_tacsnet.cpp as the main training executable
   - Don't bring back redundant training scripts (train_model.cpp, train_adaptive.cpp, etc.)
